title: Testing Considerations
description: Testing considerations for IdleTimer
---

In order to write tests that include IdleTimer, a few things will need to be mocked.
Examples will be provided for the [jest]() testing framework, but the principles
can be applied to any framework.

For jest, you will need to create a startup script and add it to the `setupFiles`
section of your `jest.config.js` or `package.json`.  We will assume the setup file 
is called `test.setup.js` for the following.

### Mock Worker Timers
IdleTimer uses the library [worker-timers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/worker-timers)
to implement hoisted timers. This prevents background throttling from producing
unexpected and inaccurate behavior. Since there are no Web Workers in a testing
context, we will need to mock this library. 

In your `test.setup.js`, add the following:

```ts
jest.mock('worker-timers', () => ({
  setTimeout: setTimeout,
  clearTimeout: clearTimeout,
  setInterval: setInterval,
  clearInterval: clearInterval
}))
```

This will have jest or your test runner of choice use the browser native methods
for testing.

### Mock Message Channel
IdleTimer uses [MessageChannel](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MessageChannel)
for the cross tab messaging layer internally.  This is not mocked by default
in js-dom. To mock it for testing, add the following to your `test.setup.js`.

```ts
import { MessageChannel } from 'worker_threads'

// @ts-ignore
global.MessageChannel = MessageChannel
```

If you are using Typescript you will have to either ignore the global assignment
or extend the global name space for your test runner.  Since you are unlikely to 
need types for the MessageChannel, `// @ts-ignore` will suffice.

With these two components mocked, you will be able to fully test your application
with IdleTimer. If you need more examples, you can check out the 
[test suite](https://github.com/supremetechnopriest/react-idle-timer/tree/master/tests) 
for IdleTimer itself.
