description: Activity Detection feature explanation and example

The activity detection feature is responsible for notifying you when any of your
watched events has been triggered, regardless of wether or not it will result in
a change of idle state.

### Properties

The properties associated with activity detection are:

{/* cspell:disable */}
- [events](/docs/props#events): The events to listen for activity on.
- [element](/docs/props#element): The DOM element to bind event listeners to.
- [onAction](/docs/props#onaction): Function called each time an event is triggered.
- [throttle](/docs/props#throttle): Throttle the `onAction` callback in milliseconds.
- [debounce](/docs/props#debounce): Debounce the `onAction` callback in milliseconds.
- [startOnMount](/docs/props#startonmount): Bind the events when the host component mounts. Defaults to `true`.
- [startManually](/docs/props#startmanually): Require a call to `start()` in order to bind the events initally.
